IVF (In Vitro Fertilization) and IUI (Intrauterine Insemination) are two common fertility treatments, but they serve different needs. IUI is less invasive and more affordable, often used in cases of mild male infertility or unexplained infertility. IVF is more advanced, involving egg retrieval, fertilization in a lab, and embryo transfer. IVF is suitable for women with blocked fallopian tubes, older age, low ovarian reserve, or severe male factor infertility. Success rates are generally higher with IVF, but itâ€™s also more expensive and intensive. Your fertility journey should be based on medical guidance, emotional readiness, and financial resources.
